# Virtual-Network-VMware
# Virtual Network with VMware

This project demonstrates how to set up a virtual network using VMware Workstation and create multiple virtual machines that can communicate with each other over a private network.

## Requirements

- VMware Workstation (tested with version 16)
- Adequate system resources (RAM, disk space, etc.)

## Setup

1. Open VMware Workstation and click on "Edit" > "Virtual Network Editor".
2. Choose "Add Network" and select "VMnet2". Set the network type to "Host-only".
3. Click "OK" to save the new network configuration.
4. Create multiple virtual machines with different operating systems, such as Windows 10, Ubuntu, and CentOS.
5. Customize the hardware settings for each virtual machine, such as CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.
6. In the network settings for each virtual machine, select "Custom: Specific virtual network" and choose "VMnet2" for the adapter.

## Configuration

1. Power on each virtual machine and configure the network settings in the operating system.
2. Set a static IP address for each virtual machine in the same subnet, such as 192.168.2.x/24.
3. Use the command line or GUI tools to test the network connectivity between the virtual machines, such as pinging or accessing shared files.
4. Use the VMware Workstation console to manage the virtual machines, such as starting, stopping, cloning, migrating, and modifying the hardware settings.

## Usage

- Use the virtual machines as you would physical machines, installing software, running services, testing configurations, etc.
- Use the virtual network to simulate a real-world network environment, such as a lab, a testing environment, a development environment, etc.
- Use the network isolation and security features of VMware Workstation to protect the virtual machines from external threats.

## Troubleshooting

- If the virtual machines cannot communicate with each other, check the network settings, the IP addresses, the firewalls, and the routing tables.
- If the virtual machines have issues with the network hardware or drivers, check the VMware Workstation logs and the device manager in the operating system.
- If the virtual machines have performance issues or conflicts, adjust the resource allocation in VMware Workstation, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network bandwidth.
